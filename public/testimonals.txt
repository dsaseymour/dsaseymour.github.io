“Danny is a pleasure to work with. His work ethic is remarkable! He is an incredible asset to this ITS team. He is extraordinarily knowledgeable and willing to ask questions to clarify and learn.”,
“It is a pleasure to say that Danny is by far the most thorough employee that we have on our staff and he has made a steady effort to learn and improve during his time here. Danny has proved to be a valuable asset to our team and I have nothing but positive things to say.”,
“Danny is an excellent employee with great work ethic and dependability. He always ensures to keep the team updated if there is an issue.
Keep up with the good work Danny!”,
“In spite of being a new member of our team, Danny has demonstrated his enthusiasm and dedication to work. He is a very reliable staff member who is willing to go the extra mile when given a task. I will highly recommend Danny to pick shifts during peak hours at the help desk which can be a great opportunity for him to learn and demonstrate his troubleshooting skills. 
Other than that, keep up with the excellent work, Danny!”,
“Danny came into the year halfway through in order to cover our night shifts, but has made a consistent effort to learn and improve by himself. I do not have any shifts with him unfortunately, but look forward to working with him in the new year.”,
“I have not worked with Danny, but I am super psyched that we have him on our work team. He seems like a great addition. Everything I have heard from and about Danny demonstrates his desire to improve himself. I hope I get to work with Danny more throughout the semester so that we can adequately acquaint him with the rest of the staff.”,
“I have not had the pleasure of working with Danny due to his middle of the semester start and late hours; but, from what I have heard Danny is a quick learner and has great troubleshooting skills. I look forward to working with Danny in the future.”
